- The game is cross platform, will be made availabe on iOS and Android, and you can play a friend on either platform
- If you join a match but then close the app or move it to the background, you may be disconnected and the game may be counted as a loss. The server will calculate this loss when you next connect
- You move players simply by touching and dragging. This is easier on some screens than others, if you're having difficulty some times double tapping the player or ball you want to move is easier! 
- In an online match you'll be randomly assigned noughts or crosses, you'll have to figure out which team you're able to move
